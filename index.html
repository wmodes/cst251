        <p><b>Wes Modes</b> is a <b>Santa Cruz</b> artist focused on social practice, sculpture, performance and new media work. He holds a MFA from the <b>Digital Art and New Media program</b> at <b>UC Santa Cruz</b>. He has exhibited his art and performance since 1996. He is an art lecturer at UC Santa Cruz, <b>California State University Monterey Bay</b>, and <b>San Jose State University</b> and former curator at the <b>Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History</b>. Wes worked in the tech industry for 25 years as a software engineer, systems administrator, and systems architect. His computer systems work includes <b>Silicon Graphics</b>, <b>Adobe</b>, and <b>UCSC</b>, serving as the primary systems architect of the <b>Grateful Dead Archive Online</b>. He is also a writer, performer, adventurer and community organizer. For more information, please visit <a href="http://modes.io">modes.io</a>.</p>

        <p>Wes' primary practice is <i>A Secret History of American River People</i>, a project that gathers and presents the oral histories of people who live and work on American rivers. Using material from fieldwork, Secret History reexamines the lifestyles, biographies, labor conditions, and history of river life. Particular attention is given to the invisible stories of women, native people, working people, and people of color, to create a complex and subtle understanding of each river’s historical narrative, to explore the importance of a public commons, and to challenge dominant cultural assumptions about the role in society of people living at the fringe. (<a href="http://peoplesriverhistory.us">peoplesriverhistory.us</a>)</p>

        <p>The project recalls <b>Suzanne Lacy</b>’s dialogical works, the community-based work of <b>Helen and Newton Harrison</b>, and the contemporary water-based practice of <b>Duke Riley</b>, <b>Eve Mosher</b>, <b>Mary Mattingly</b>, and others. Outside of my immediate discipline, it recalls the work of social documentarians, <b>Dorothea Lange</b>, <b>Walker Evans</b>, <b>Alan Lomax</b>, and <b>Howard Zinn</b>. </p>

        <p>This piece is a multi-layered art and social history project that presents its rich findings through installation, photography, digital video, new media, and book projects. A Secret History has been exhibited since 2014 at art, science, and history museums nationwide in conjunction with explorations on the Upper Mississippi River, the Tennessee River, California's Sacramento River, and New York's Hudson River. </p>
